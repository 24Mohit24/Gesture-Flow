# GestureFlow: Virtual Mouse Control with OpenCV

## Overview

GestureFlow is a Python-based project that introduces a virtual mouse, leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV for precise computer cursor control through intuitive hand gestures captured via webcam. This innovative system provides an alternative and intuitive approach to traditional mouse interaction, offering a hands-free experience for users.

## Key Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes OpenCV for real-time video processing and analysis to recognize and track hand gestures.
  
- **Intuitive Control:** Enables users to control the computer cursor through predefined hand gestures, such as swipes and clicks.
  
- **Responsive Interaction:** The system ensures accurate and responsive interaction, enhancing user experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
